### Morning Report: 07.00 London

Haven assets spiked yesterday on news of a missile overshooting Japan from North Korea yesterday. Gold spiked to its highest levels since the Presidential election yesterday, but is easing back this morning. Silver is following suit. 

Yen pairs are following the same pattern with a spike in demand for the yen driving yen pairs lower, but with a counter relief move setting in this morning. The AUD/JPY is lagging in its recovery after suffering some of the heaviest falls yesterday due to its proximity to the areas of tension. 

Dollar pairs remain around the highs though after Friday's dollar reversal. Once again the AUD/USD is lagging, while the GBP/USD out performs. 

The EUR/GBP is off the pace as the euro backs off slightly and the pound gains.

### Coming up today

US Consumer Confidence is the only economic news item of note today at 15.00
